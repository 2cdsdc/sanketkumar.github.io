  <p><b>Category:</b> CAD Design</p>
  <p><b>Tools Used:</b> SolidWorks</p>

  <p>
    This project involves the complete CAD modeling of an ABB-style
    industrial robotic arm. The design focuses on realistic joint
    articulation, structural integrity, and accurate component
    proportions suitable for industrial automation applications.

  <h2>Design Approach</h2>
  <p>
    Each segment of the robot arm was modeled as an individual part and
    assembled using appropriate mates to replicate real-world rotational
    and translational motion. Special attention was given to the base,
    arm joints, and end-effector interface to ensure mechanical realism.

  <h2>Results & Learnings</h2>
  <p>
    The final assembly successfully demonstrates realistic robot arm
    geometry and articulation. This project strengthened my understanding
    of complex assemblies, joint constraints, and industrial robot design
    principles used in automated manufacturing systems.
