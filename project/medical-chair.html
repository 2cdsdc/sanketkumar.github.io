    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project focuses on the <strong>CAD modeling and functional modification</strong> of a medical chair designed for clinical environments.
      The primary objective was to integrate a <strong>heating system</strong> within the chair to improve patient comfort during extended procedures.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Design Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ergonomically contoured seat, backrest, and leg support</li>
      <li>Modular structure allowing easy maintenance and upgrades</li>
      <li>Integrated heater zones positioned for patient comfort</li>
      <li>Stable wheeled base for mobility within medical facilities</li>
      <li>Storage drawers integrated into the base structure</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
    <div class="tech-stack">
      <span>SolidWorks</span>
      <span>Surface Modeling</span>
      <span>Parametric Design</span>
      <span>Assembly Modeling</span>
      <span>Design for Comfort</span>
    </div>

    <h2>Engineering Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      Special attention was given to maintaining <strong>structural integrity</strong> while introducing heaters into the chair assembly.
      The design ensures that heating elements do not interfere with mechanical components, patient safety, or ease of cleaning.
    </p>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      The final CAD model successfully demonstrates a practical and manufacturable medical chair design that balances
      <strong>comfort, functionality, and safety</strong>. The project highlights skills in mechanical design,
      ergonomic modeling, and real-world product modification.
